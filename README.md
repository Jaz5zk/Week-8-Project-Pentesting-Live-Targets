# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets  Time

spent: **X** hours spent in total  

âž¢	Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.  
The six possible exploits are: 
	* Username Enumeration 
	* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) 
	* SQL Injection (SQLi) 
	* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
	* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
	* Session Hijacking/Fixation  

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)
